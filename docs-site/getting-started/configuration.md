# Configuration

Create a `drift.yaml` in your project root to customize detection behavior.

## Minimal Example

```yaml
include:
  - "**/*.py"
exclude:
  - "**/node_modules/**"
  - "**/venv/**"
fail_on: high
```

# Architecture boundaries
policies:
  layer_boundaries:
    - name: "No DB imports in API layer"
      from: "api/**"
      deny_import: ["db.*", "models.*"]
    - name: "No API imports in DB layer"
      from: "db/**"
      deny_import: ["api.*", "routes.*"]

# CI severity gate
fail_on: high
```

## Signal Weights

Weights control the relative importance of each signal in the composite score. They are normalized internally — they don't need to sum to 1.0.

Default weights are calibrated via ablation study (see [Scoring Model](../algorithms/scoring.md)).

## Architecture Policies

Layer boundaries define which imports are allowed between modules. This is the most impactful configuration for the Architecture Violation Signal (AVS).
